ðŸŽ® Terminal-based Multiplayer Game (Networking)
ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Traditional multiplayer games rely heavily on graphical user interfaces, making them resource-intensive and less accessible in low-resource environments. This project aims to design and implement a real-time multiplayer game that runs entirely within the terminal using ASCII graphics.

The challenge is to provide a fun and engaging experienceâ€”similar to classics like Snake, Pong battle, or simple turn-based strategy gamesâ€”while ensuring lightweight execution and networked interaction.

To achieve this, the system must:

Use a client-server architecture to connect multiple players over a network.

Handle real-time communication and game state synchronization between players.

Manage game logic, player inputs, and state updates efficiently within a terminal interface.

Ensure fair play, smooth experience, and low latency despite running in a text-based environment.
