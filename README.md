ðŸŽ® Terminal-based Multiplayer Game (Networking)
ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Most multiplayer games need heavy graphics and powerful systems, which makes them harder to run on low-resource machines. This project solves that problem by creating a real-time multiplayer game that works completely in the terminal using simple ASCII graphics (text-based visuals).

The goal is to make the game fun and engaging, just like old classics such as Snake, Pong, or simple turn-based games, but still lightweight and easy to run.
